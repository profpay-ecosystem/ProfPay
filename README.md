## üíº About the Project

**ProfPay** is a cryptocurrency wallet designed for secure transactions using **USDT (TRC20)** and **TRX**.
The wallet is equipped with a smart contract system for handling USDT TRC20 transactions, providing advanced security features to protect users' funds.

Key features:
- **Main Address and Six Additional Slots**: The wallet has one primary address and six additional slots that act as protective barriers against dirty currency. If a slot receives dirty currency, it can be replaced with clean funds.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Currently, the wallet supports **USDT** and **TRX**, with plans to add more cryptocurrencies in the future.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build and Installation (via Docker)

### üß© 1. Generate the Keystore (JKS file)

To build a **release APK**, you must have a **Java Keystore (JKS)** file used for signing your Android app.
If you don‚Äôt already have one, generate it using:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore profpay-release-key.jks \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000 \
  -alias profpay
```

### üß© 2. Export Required Environment Variables
Before building, export the following variables that will be used during the Docker build process:

```bash
export KEYSTORE_FILE=profpay-release-key.jks
export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=password_from_keystore
export KEY_ALIAS=profpay
export KEY_PASSWORD=password_key
```

### üß© 3. Build the Project via Docker
Run the following command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
sudo docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.release \
  --build-arg KEYSTORE_FILE=$KEYSTORE_FILE \
  --build-arg KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD \
  --build-arg KEY_ALIAS=$KEY_ALIAS \
  --build-arg KEY_PASSWORD=$KEY_PASSWORD \
  -t wallet-builder .
```

### üß© 4. Extract the Final APK
After the build finishes, extract the generated .apk from the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/out wallet-builder cp /app/app-release.apk /out/
```

The signed `app-release.apk` will be copied to your current project directory:
```
./app-release.apk
```
